# See https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#how-can-i-specify-the-encryption-passphrase-programmatically for different ways of programatically passing borg passphrase
# Ideally, we should have used macOS keychain for reading borg password but I couldn't get to read keychain password from cron even after trying some recommended solutions (ex. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/266615/how-to-access-keychain-of-my-user-from-cron)
# It probably would have worked if we defined launchctl job instead but cron job felt much more convenient compared to creating and maintaining launchctl job
# Additionally, /usr/sbin/cron has been given Full Disk Access (https://osxdaily.com/2020/04/27/fix-cron-permissions-macos-full-disk-access/) so that it can access user's protected directories (such as Desktop)
# Command is retried twice to take care of random errors
